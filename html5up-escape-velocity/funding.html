							<p>Abortion funds exist to cover the costs of your abortion care. In Philadelphia, minors who go through the judicial bypass process do not need to pay ANY money for the cost of their care. If you are able to cover any amount, whether that be $200, $50, or $5, the clinic will appreciate any contribution. However, you will NOT be turned away if you can’t pay. The clinics can work with you to apply for abortion funding. If you choose to not participate in the judicial bypass process and instead get your abortion in New Jersey, those clinics can assist you in securing funding but everything may not be covered.</p>

							<p>Some funds require the patient themself call the fund hotline, and other funds require the clinic representative to complete the application. The resources below include two of the funds available to you. </p>

								<p>From the website: “The National Abortion Hotline Fund has limited funding available for people seeking abortion care. Please call the NAF Hotline for more information and to see if you qualify for funding assistance…In order to determine if you qualify for funding, you will need to know your household size and income. If you qualify for funding you will need to know your appointment date, the name of the clinic you are going to, how far along you are in the pregnancy (including the date of your last period), and the total price that you were quoted by the clinic. If you do not have all the above information, you may still call and be screened for financial assistance, but we may not be able to complete the funding process in one call”    </p>

								<p>215-564-6622</p>
								<p>From the website: “Our goal in each call is to get essential info in order to process your funding with your abortion provider, provide the funding and any referrals you may need, and to offer a kind, non- judgemental space.  All questions we ask are optional and confidential. You can share as much or as little as you’d like to. Most calls last about 10 minutes. If we need to, we may schedule a call back with you. You will be prompted to leave a message with the following information; say and spell your first and last name, your phone number, which clinic you are going to, the date of your abortion appointment, and let us know if it is OK for us to leave a voicemail identifying ourselves as the ALF-PA or if we should say this message is from your friend Jordyn. We will reach back out to you within 24 or 48 hours.”
