                <h2>Finding Abortion Funding</h2>
                <p>Abortion funds exist to cover the costs of your abortion care. In Philadelphia, minors who go through the judicial bypass process do not need to pay ANY money for the cost of their care. If you are able to cover any amount, whether that be $200, $50, or $5, the clinic will appreciate any contribution. However, you will NOT be turned away if you can’t pay. The clinics can work with you to apply for abortion funding. If you choose to not participate in the judicial bypass process and instead get your abortion in New Jersey, those clinics can assist you in securing funding but everything may not be covered.</p>

                <p>Some funds require the patient themself call the fund hotline, and other funds require the clinic representative to complete the application. The resources below include two of the funds available to you. </p>

Please call the NAF Hotline for more information and to see if you qualify for funding assistance…In order to determine if you qualify for funding, you will need to know your household size and income. If you qualify for funding you will need to know your appointment date, the name of the clinic you are going to, how far along you are in the pregnancy (including the date of your last period), and the total price that you were quoted by the clinic. If you do not have all the above information, you may still call and be screened for financial assistance, but we may not be able to complete the funding process in one call”    </p>
