                    <h3>Step 1: Initial Appointment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your journey begins with an appointment with an abortion provider. Law requires that you attend an information session at least 24 hours before your procedure. This can happen in person or over the phone, depending on the clinic.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Legal Consultation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Next, speak with a Child Advocacy Unit attorney to understand the judicial bypass process, answer any background questions, and prepare for your court appearance.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Court Petition</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Child Advocacy Unit will then submit a petition to the court on your behalf, which is the official request for a judicial bypass.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Bypass Hearing</h3>
                    <p>
                        The judicial bypass hearing is scheduled to take place every Thursday at 9 am at 1501 Arch St. Your privacy is a priority; you'll be identified only by your initials, and the proceedings are confidential.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 5: Procedure Approval</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the judge grants your bypass, you will receive a signed and stamped order of approval. With this document, you're ready to proceed. If you haven't already scheduled your abortion appointment, now is the time to call your provider.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Final Step: Clinic Visit</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the day of your appointment, bring the signed court approval order to the clinic to show that the judicial bypass has been granted. If you face any issues with scheduling or funding, please reach out to your attorney for assistance.
