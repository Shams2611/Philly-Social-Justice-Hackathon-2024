                    The Defender Association has helped hundreds of minors navigate the judicial bypass process and are
                    a welcoming, safe, and confidential resource. The attorneys will review what a judicial bypass is,
                    ask some questions so they can fill out the paperwork required to schedule a hearing, and then the
                    attorney will give an overview of what to expect during the judicial bypass hearing and review what
                    questions the judge will likely ask you.
